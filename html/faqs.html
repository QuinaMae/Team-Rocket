			<h3> Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
	<div>
				<div class="q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Can you still get infected even if you're vaccinated?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Yes, the chances of getting infected with COVID-19 is still possible, but the chance of going into critical condition is slimmer. At most, it will be a low infection to mild infection case. This case is called a breakthrough infection wherein a fully vaccinated person is infected.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class ="q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>When to seek emergency care if infected by COVID-19?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>It is advisable to call your Local Government or doctor as soon as possible and striclty follow their instructions. Avoid outdoors as much as possible, public transportation, follow proper social distancing. And isolate yourself in a room, far from your family and wait for further instructions from your local government/doctor.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div  class="question"><label>Do's and Don'ts when in a public area</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label> -Do wash your hands for at least 20 seconds serveral times per day.<br>
						-Do practice social distancing especially if the person is coughing or sneezing. Avoid gatherings as it can spread quickly if one is infected.<br>
						-Do know the proper way to put on and remove the mask.<br>
						-Do sanitize your hand from time to time especially when entering a shop or restaurant. <br>
						-Do minimize physical contract like shakehands, fist bump, and other gestures when meeting someone. <br>
						<br>
						-Don't travel if you have a fever.<br>
						-Don't wear a mask unless you're sick as the masks only help protect others from catching the virus and wearing one while you're healthy won't do much.<br>
						-Don't touch your eyes,nose, and mouth as the virus can quickly spread with contact.<br>
						-Don't put a mask on young child under age 2. It's better if the child stays at home to lessen the risk of getting in contact with covid-19<br>
						-Don't go near seniors or those at higher risk for severe illness.</label></div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>When to get booster dose?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>After taking the second dose, individuals should wait for 8 months before taking a booster shot. </label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>How quickly could covid-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>It depends on the effectiveness of vaccines, how quickly they are aprroved, manufactured, and delivered. It will take longer as COVID-19 vaccines will not be 100% effective.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Will the vaccines protect me from covid-19?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from COVID-19, especially sever illness and death.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>What are the benefits of getting vaccinated?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>The benefits of getting vaccinated are preventing hospitalization, and death.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Who should get vaccinated?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Health workers have a high risk of exposure and older people should be prioritized for vaccination.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Can I stop taking safety precautions after being vaccinated?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>No, you should still follow the safety precautions as you are not 100% immune of COVID-19.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Should I be vaccinated if I have been infected with covid-19?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Waiting for a few weeks is recommended if you have been infected by COVID-19. You should have no symptoms at all and you should feel perfectly well when you take your vaccination to prevent health workers at risk.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>What are the side effects of vaccines in men and women?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>The mild side effects include soreness, headache, fatigue, diziness, chills, and nausea. Also women have been reported that they have more side effects from COVID-19 vaccine than men.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Does the side effect imply that the vaccine is working?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Common and mild side effects are a good thing when vaccinated. It shows that the vaccine is working and experiencing no side effects doesn't mean the vaccine is ineffective because everybody responds differently.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>I have been vaccinated and I had not felt any of the common side effects</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>The COVID-19 vaccine is still working even without side effect. It's likely related to the immune system and its response as to why there might be no reaction. Women and younger people are more likely to experience reactions after the vaccine.</label></div>
				</div>

			  <div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Can people get COVID-19 from pets or other animals?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a></label>
					<blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html#:~:text=At%20this%20time%2C%20there%20is,COVID%2D19%2C%20to%20people.&text=Some%20coronaviruses%20that%20infect%20animals,people%2C%20but%20this%20is%20rare."> "At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2".</blockquote></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>What are the early symptoms of COVID-19?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Once an individual has contracted the virus, it can take 2-14 days for symptoms to show. The average incubation period is roughly 5-6 days. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a person with COVID-19 can experience
						a range of symptoms, often including a dry cough and shortness of breath. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and tiredness, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell. </label></div>
					</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Can you contract the virus after receiving the 1st vaccine dose?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>Yes, a person will achieve immunity after gaining the second dose of a two shot vaccine. Unless the vaccine that you have chosen is ohnson & Johnson that only require 1 shot.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>When can I get my 2nd dose of vaccine after contracting CoVid-19 after my 1st dose of vaccine?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>10 days after your first symptom has started. If you still have a fever or other symptoms, stay insolation and if symptoms still persist, stay in isolation until 21 days have passed since you started having symptoms.</label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>Will the COVID-19 vaccine provide long-term protection?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label>According to World Health Organization</label> <blockquote cite= "https://www.who.int"> “Because COVID vaccines have only been developed in the past months, it’s too early to know the duration of protection of COVID-19 vaccines. Research is ongoing to answer this question. However, it’s encouraging that available data suggest that most people who recover from COVID-19 develop an immune response that provides at least some period of protection against reinfection – although we’re still learning how strong this protection is, and how long it lasts.“</blockquote></div>

			 <div class = "q-a">
				 <div class="question"><label>What happens if I choose a different vaccine for my second dose?</label></div><br>
					<div class="answer"><label><i>It is recommended to have the same vaccine as you had the first dose. As of the moment the data about interchanging are insufficient.</i></label></div>
				</div>

				<div class = "q-a">
					<div class="question"><label>What types of vaccines are being developed? and how do they work?</label></div><br>
        	<div class="answer"><label>Based on <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/there-are-four-types-covid-19-vaccines-heres-how-they-work">The Gavi Organization</a>
                    There are 4 types of COVID-19 vaccines:<br></label>

										<br>
                  	<i>1. Whole Vaccine</i><br>
                        Whole virus vaccines use a weakened (attenuated) or deactivated form of the pathogen that causes a disease to trigger protective immunity to it.  There are two types of whole virus vaccines. Live attenuated vaccine and Inactivated vaccine. Both are tried and tested vaccination strategies, which form the basis of many existing vaccines – including those for yellow fever and measles (live attenuated vaccines), or seasonal influenza and hepatitis A (inactivated vaccines). Bacterial attenuated vaccines also exist, such as the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis.<br><br>

                    	<label><u>A. Live Attenuated Vaccine</u>: this is a weakened form of the virus, which can still grow and replicate, but does not cause illness.</label>
                      <div class="faqs-image"><img class="virus" src="../images/Others/live.jpg" alt="Live Attenuated Vaccine photo" width="200" height="200"></div>

										<br/>
	                 		<label><u>B. Inactivated Vaccine</u>:it contain viruses whose genetic material has been destroyed by heat, chemicals or radiation so they cannot infect cells and replicate, but can still trigger an immune response.</label>
                        <div class="faqs-image"><img class="virus" src="../images/Others/inactivated.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Inactivated Vaccine photo"></div>
                    			<div class="image-sources"><small>(Image from <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained">WHO)</a></small></div>

										<br/>
                    <label><i>2. Protein Subunit</i><br>
                        Rather than injecting a whole pathogen to trigger an immune response, subunit vaccines (sometimes called acellular vaccines) contain purified pieces of it, which have been specially selected for their ability to stimulate immune cells. Because these fragments are incapable of causing disease, subunit vaccines are considered very safe. There are several types: protein subunit vaccines contain specific isolated proteins from viral or bacterial pathogens; polysaccharide vaccines contain chains of sugar molecules (polysaccharides) found in the cell walls of some bacteria; conjugate subunit vaccines bind a polysaccharide chain to a carrier protein to try and boost the immune response. Only protein subunit vaccines are being developed against the virus that causes COVID-19.</label>

                    				<div class="image-sources"><small>(Image from <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained">WHO)</a></small></div>

									<br/>
                    <label><i>3. Nucleic</i><br>
                        Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material from a disease-causing virus or bacterium (a pathogen) to stimulate an immune response against it. Depending on the vaccine, the genetic material could be DNA or RNA; in both cases it provides the instructions for making a specific protein from the pathogen, which the immune system will recognise as foreign (an antigen). Once inserted into host cells, this genetic material is read by the cell’s own protein-making machinery and used to manufacture antigens, which then trigger an immune response.<br><br>
                        This is a relatively new technology, so although DNA and RNA vaccines are being developed against various diseases, including HIV, Zika virus and COVID-19, so far none of them have yet been approved for human use. Several DNA vaccines are licenced for animal use, including a horse vaccine against West Nile virus.</label>
                     		<div class="faqs-image"><img class="virus" src="../images/Others/nucleic.jpg" width="500" alt="Nucleic acid vaccine photo"></div>
                    				<div class="image-sources"><small>(Image from <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained">WHO)</a></small></div>

									<br/>
                    <label><i>4. Viral Vector</i>
                        Viral vector-based vaccines differ from most conventional vaccines in that they don’t actually contain antigens, but rather use the body’s own cells to produce them. They do this by using a modified virus (the vector) to deliver genetic code for antigen, in the case of COVID-19 spike proteins found on the surface of the virus, into human cells. By infecting cells and instructing them to make large amounts of antigen, which then trigger an immune response, the vaccine mimics what happens during natural infection with certain pathogens - especially viruses. This has the advantage of triggering a strong cellular immune response by T cells as well the production of antibodies by B cells. An example of a viral vector vaccine is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine against Ebola.</label>

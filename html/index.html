								<small class="date">07 September 2021</small>
									<p>
										State-owned Philippine Amusement Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) committed to provide some P65 million for the implementation of various priority development projects of the city government to help in sustaining the growth and development of the country’s undisputed Summer Capital.
										<br><br>
										PAGCOR Chairperson Andrea Domingo made the commitment to Mayor Benjamin B. Magalong during a recent meeting on how the State corporation will be able to help in improving the city.
										<br><br>
										Mayor Magalong disclosed that some P50 million will be used to put up 2 multipurpose buildings in identified barangays in the city  capable of providing the required 1,000-square meter land for the said structures while another P10 million will be used to improve the city-owned Baguio Post Office park.
										<br><br>
										Further, he added that PAGCOR is willing to provide another P3 to P5 million for the procurement of information and communication technology (ICT) equipment that can be used by the city government to further improve the delivery of basic services to the residents in the city’s 128 barangays.
										<br><br>
										He claimed he made representations with PAGCOR for the relaxation of the guidelines in the land area that will be provided as counterpart for the construction of the aforesaid multipurpose centers where the required 1,500-squater property for the P25 million funding support was reduced to only 1,000 square meters.
										<br><br>
										According to him, the committed funds will be downloaded to the local government this year to ensure the immediate implementation of the projects that will boost the sustained development of the city amidst the ongoing Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 2019 pandemic.
										<br><br>
										The chief executive requested the concerned offices of the city government to look for the barangays that are suitable to host these projects and prepare their plans and specifications of the for submission to the PAGCOR to support the release of the funds.
										<br><br>
										He urged the concerned offices to speed up their compliance to the requirements for the release of the committed funding because Chairperson Domingo wants these to be realized before she retires from the service and that she wants to leave a legacy as a resident of the country’s Summer Capital.
										<br><br>
										The mayor expressed his gratitude to Chairperson Domingo for her gesture in committing the release of the funds as these will surely go a long way in supporting the ongoing efforts to sustain the improvement of major parks around the city’s central business district and pursue the development of the barangays.
										<br><br>
										The city intends to develop major parks around the city with the support of the private sector to ensure that these are well maintained for the gradual and safe revival of the local tourism industry. - Dexter A. See

								<h4><a href="https://baguio.gov.ph/content/baguio-dengue-fever-cases-rise-600-percent">BAGUIO DENGUE FEVER CASES RISE BY 600 PERCENT</a></h4>
								<small class="date">07 September 2021</small>
								<p>
									Local health authorities raised concern over the reported 6-fold increase in dengue fever cases in the city for the first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year.
									<br><br>
									Donabel Tubera-Panes, Medical Officer IV and head of the City Health Services Office’s Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (CHSO-CESU), disclosed that from January 1 to August 30, 2021,  a total of 891 dengue fever cases was recorded from the various barangays compared to the only 124 cases reported during the same period last year.
									<br><br>
									She claimed that the age range of the dengue fever cases in the city is from 1 month to 90 years old with a median of 26 years.
									<br><br>
									Further, Panes claimed that majority of the dengue fever cases are males which represent 53.1 percent of the cases while 13 percent of the cases belong to the 15-19 age group.
									<br><br>
									The medical officer added that for the reckoning period, there were 8 reported dengue-related deaths: an 18-year old female from Camp 8 barangay; a 3-year old male from Camp 8 barangay; an 11-year old male from Loakan Proper; a 65-year old female from Victoria Village; a 15-year old male from Sto. Tomas Proper; a 47-year-old male from Upper Quirino-Magsaysay barangay; a 16-year old male from Honeymoon barangay and a 6-year old female from Engineers’ Hill barangay.
									<br><br>
									According to her, there were clustering of cases in some barangays in the city, particularly, BGH Compound, Camp 8, Camp 7, Pinsao Proper, Brookside, Camdas Subdivision, Asin road, Loakan Liwanag, Irisan, Sto. Tomas Proper, Loakan Proper, City Camp Proper, St. Joseph Village, Poliwes, Lower Quirino Hill, San Antonio Village, Hillside, San Luis Village, Lower Magsaysay, Fairview, Aurora Hill Proper, San Vicente, Guisad Central, Happy Hallow, Bakakeng Norte/Sur, Pinsao Pilot Project, Atok Trail, Kias and Bakakeng Central.
									<br><br>
									Based on the 5-year dengue fever data for the city from January to December, there were some 2,808 cases reported in 2016, 500 cases in 2017, 434 cases in 2018, 839 cases in 2019 and 162 cases in 2020 while there were already 891 cases for the first 8 months of this year.
									<br><br>
									Panes stipulated that dengue fever has established a cyclic trend where the number of cases drastically increase every 3 to 4 years, thus, it is considered that for this year, dengue fever cases are expected to significantly increase pursuant to the past trend.
									<br><br>
									She urged residents, especially in the barangays that have reported clustering of cases, to sustain the practice of the search and destroy the breeding places of dengue carrying mosquitoes, seek early medical attention when experiencing symptoms, employ self-protection measures such as the wearing of long-sleeved clothes and say no to fogging except during outbreaks.
									<br><br>
									She asserted the importance of the residents getting rid of the breeding ground of dengue carrying mosquitoes, such as containers of clear and stagnant water, or for them to sustain the practice of the Plan Taub to prevent the multiplication of the said mosquitoes that could cause the clustering of cases in certain households or even in the community and ensure the protection of the people from the illness that is caused by the female mosquito. - Dexter A.

								<h4><a href="https://baguio.gov.ph/content/noticeable-decrease-travelers-entering-baguio-noted">NOTICEABLE DECREASE IN TRAVELERS ENTERING BAGUIO NOTED</a></h4>
									<small class="date">07 September 2021</small>
										<p>
											The Baguio City Police Office (BCPO) noted a significant decrease in the number of travelers wanting to enter the city through the various quarantine checkpoints (QCPs) following the strict implementation of border control measures to contain the rapid spread of the dreaded Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 2019 with the ongoing threat of its Delta variant.
											<br><br>
											BCPO City Director Police Col. Glen Lonogan stated that there had been a significant reduction on the volume of motorists travelling to the city even during the weekends when there is supposed to be influx of people from outside that is why they are grateful for the cooperation of the public in observing the strict enforcement of the border control measures.
											<br><br>
											He added that police personnel managing the different QTPs in strategic entry points of the city turned back some 50 to 70 travelers wanting to enter the city daily because their travels are either not essential or they do not possess the required travel documents.
											<br><br>
											Last month, alert police personnel apprehended 14 travelers who possessed fake travel documents in trying to enter the city while nearly 500 travelers were ordered to return to their points of origin for failure to prove that their travel to the city was essential or they did not have the required travel documents.
											<br><br>
											Further, four motor vehicles that were impounded by the police because of their intention to smuggle to the city individuals who do not have sufficient travel documents, among others.
											<br><br>
											Lonogan claimed that the police personnel managing the different QTPs remain vigilant in inspecting the documents of travelers wanting to enter the city to ensure their travels are essential and that they possess the required travel documents to avoid possible infection that might cause the unnecessary surge in COVID-19 cases in the city.
											<br><br>
											The police official called on travelers not to take chances in trying to enter the city without possessing the appropriate travel documents as they will be compelled to go back to their points of origin, especially if it will be proven that their travels are not essential.
											<br><br>
											According to him, the cooperation of the travelers wanting to enter the city on non-essential travels and without the required travel documents will definitely help in easing the burden of the police personnel at the different checkpoints.
											<br><br>
											He pointed out that travelers should not attempt to enter the city using fake documents as appropriate charges will be filed against them that could result to their eventual detention or delays in their supposed transactions in the city if their travels are essential, thus, they should abide by the ongoing implementation of the stricter border controls.
											<br><br>
											Lonogan added that the police personnel will continue performing their duties and responsibilities to the fullest and with utmost dedication to ensure that unnecessary travels by travelers to the city will be prevented to avert the spread of the virus in the city. - Dexter A. See

								<small class = "date">02 September 2021</small>
									<p>
											The city government of Baguio is working closely with several government agencies to fortify
											efforts in enlivening programs and projects relative to culture, arts, crafts and heritage.<br><br>
											This was announced by Mayor Benjamin B. Magalong in his 2021 State of the City Address delivered during the celebration of 112th Baguio Charter Day on September 1 at the Baguio Convention Center.<br><br>
											For the hard infrastructure, Magalong said the city government is pursuing the conversion of the old Diplomat Hotel at the Dominican Hill into a Culture, Arts and Heritage Center. A master development plan is being worked out but this would require a whooping budget of P323 million due to major engineering works. The mayor said the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) committed to support the project that will enable the establishment of a Baguio Academy for Culture and the Arts.<br><br>
											Also being worked out is the Cultural Mapping Project of the city under the guidance of the NCCA and we will institutionalize the following noteworthy activities: Ibagiw Festival, the Montañosa Film Festival, the Mangan Taku, Sabsabong ti Mayo Floral Sculpture and the Mandeko Kito.<br><br>
											The city likewise partnered with the Department of Science and Technology - Cordillera Administrative Region (DOST-CAR) in order to support the project on upgrading of the loom weaving industry in Baguio.
											<br><br>
											Early this year, city officials signed Ordinance No. 45, series of 2021 that formalized the creation of the Creative Baguio City Council (CBCC) and consequently sworn-in the officers and members of the group with Adelaida Lim, representing the weavers’ sector, as chairperson and Raymundo Rovillos, representing the academe, as vice-chairperson.  Mayor Magalong is co-chairperson.<br><br>
											The CBCC will spearhead the development and implementation of strategic plans and programs on crafts and folk arts pursuant to the city’s commitment with UNESCO as a creative city for crafts and folk arts in 2017, the first ever in the Philippines for a city to be vested with the honor of being one of the 44 countries that constitute the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.<br><br>
											“We should strengthen our efforts to flourish not only on crafts and folk arts but expansively on other artistic expressions that are home-grown in Baguio,” the mayor said. – Jessa Samidan

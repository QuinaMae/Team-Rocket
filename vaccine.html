				<h3>About Vaccines</h3>

			<div class="container">
				<div id="main">To understand how COVID-19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells, which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells fight infection in different ways:<br/><br/>
				</div>


				<div id="content1">
					<b>Macrophages</b> are white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs and dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs, called “antigens”. The body identifies antigens as dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them.<br>
					<b>B-lymphocytes</b> are defensive white blood cells. They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages.<br>
					<b>T-lymphocytes</b> are another type of defensive white blood cell. They attack cells in the body that have already been infected.<br><br>
				</div>

				<div id="content2">
					The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the person’s immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease.<br>
				</div>
				<div id="content3">The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes, called “memory cells,” that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. When the familiar antigens are detected, B-lymphocytes produce antibodies to attack them. Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19.</div>

			<h3>Brief History</h3>
		</div>
			<br>
			<p>On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was formally notified about a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, home to 11 million people and the cultural and economic hub of central China. By 5 January, 59 cases were known and none had been fatal. Ten days later, WHO was aware of 282 confirmed cases, of which four were in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. There had been six deaths in Wuhan, 51 people were severely ill and 12 were in a critical condition. The virus responsible was isolated on 7 January and its genome shared on 12 January. The cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome that became known as COVID-19 was a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.</p>
			<p>The origin and source of the SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown, although the initial cases have been associated with the Huanan South China Seafood Market where snakes, birds and other animals such as bats were sold. Considering that many of the early patients worked in or visited the market in contrast to the exported cases, it was suggested either a human to human transmission or a more widespread animal source. 
				However, evidence of human to human transmission became strongly supported on January 22nd, 2020 after a visit conducted by a WHO delegation to the city of Wuhan. Since the first outbreak recognized in February 2020, the disease spread rapidly around the world. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of 17th of June 2020; 8,142,129 cases of COVID-19 and 443,488 deaths have been reported worldwide since 31st December 2019.</p>
		 	<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now dominating the lives of everyone, and its history is constantly being rewritten. This article gives a brief account of the story so far: where SARS-CoV-2 might have originated, how it compares with other viruses that cause major respiratory disease, and some of the treatments and vaccines currently being investigated to combat it.</p>
